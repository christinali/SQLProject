Install PostgreSQL via your Operating System's package manager (brew, apt-get, etc.).

run the command './setup.sh'
This may take a few minutes as it is loading all the data we have (quite a lot) into a PostgreSQL database. 

Start the backend Flask server (which will provide a REST API for the frontend and interface with the PostgreSQL database) by running 'python3 server/app.py'
