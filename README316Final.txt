To load our production data, we essentially used a script that would allow us to generate strings of random length to represent comments. This script works by having a sample database of words (i.e. a lorem ipsum table), and then using random generation to select an arbitrary length of comments as well as arbitrarily picking what words fill that comment. This script also outputs in the form of INSERT INTO statements, which allow us to directly pipe the output into our database. We have attached the script here for the tables: students, taken, classes, and teach, but the same script is used to generate the random data for all our tables (i.e. modifying the lorem ipsum table to a table of names and then randomly selecting names) through the same process.
